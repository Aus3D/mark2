# Aus3D Mark2 3D Printer Kit

## Overview
The Aus3D Mark2 3D Printer kit is designed to be a high-quality, easy to assemble kit-based printer. Quality and capability were the primary design goals, and the Mark2 is a printer that will not disappoint in these areas. It is based off of the [RepRap Prusa Mendel i3](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/I3) design, however the Mark2 has been redesigned from the ground up to be sturdier and more capable than traditional i3-based printers. Threaded rod and printed fasteners have been replaced with extra-thick 10mm acrylic, and the frame has been designed to to reduce vibrations - minimising excess noise and improving print quality, even during strenuous, high-frequency motions. The typical threaded-rod Z-axis has been replaced with an improved lead screw driven system, reducing Z-backlash and allowing for smoother Z motion. The rigid frame ensures all axes are held square, ensuring optimal print quality.
